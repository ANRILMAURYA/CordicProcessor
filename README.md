# CordicProcessor
• Implementation of Cordic Processor on Xilinx
Cordic-based Processor for sine/cosinecalculation
– A Cordic-based Processor for sine/cosine calculation with input range being from -90 to +90 degrees which is
provided in 2’s complement form and output being in same representations input.
– Cordic is hardware effiient algorithm which is suitable for solving the trigonometric relationships involved in plane
coordinate rotation and conversion from rectangular to polar form.
– Tools & technologies used: Verilog HDL,Xilinx
